Hello Ethan Barker!

My records state that you're not in a pair.

(If this is incorrect please get in touch!)

We've reviewed your COM3505 assessment 1 from
https://gitlab.com/ebarker4/com3505-student-2023

Congratulations, you've passed!

As you know, we don't provide marks for this part of the course
assessment, but if we _were_ doing so, we would estimate your work to
be somewhere in the 1st quartile.

That's excellent work, well done!

Some feedback:
Your documentation provides a clear and concise explanation of the
device you have built and how it meets the requirements of the rubric.
You have included a detailed description of the hardware and software
components used, including the libraries, GPIO pins, and functions.

The docs could be longer and use images more ;)

Your C++ code looks good.

Overall, good job!
